This project's goal to make a pocket "watch" that will last and run as long as possible and count down to a set date/time. Using an E-Paper display that will be updated maybe twice per day and a STM32L010xx MCU running on its internal low power clock to achieve very long runtime on a CR2430 coin cell.

This project is still in its very early stages right now, don't expect too much.
